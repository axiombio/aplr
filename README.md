# APLR
Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression.

# About
Build interpretable parametric machine learning models in Python based on the Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression methodology developed by Mathias von Ottenbreit.

# How to install
pip install aplr

# How to use
Please see the two example Python scripts in the examples folder. They cover common use cases, but not all of the functionality in this package. For example, fitting with user-specified observation weights is possible but the example scripts do not use this functionality.

# Sponsorship
Please sponsor Ottenbreit Data Science by clicking on the Sponsor button. Sufficient funding will enable maintenance of APLR and further development, such as developing a classifier based on APLR.

# API reference
A thorough API reference will be provided given that Ottenbreit Data Science surpasses a total of 1000$ in received sponsorship funds. The reason is that it will take some time to write it and the work will not start until sufficient funding is available.
