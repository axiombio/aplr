# APLR
Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression.

# About
Build predictive and interpretable parametric machine learning models in Python based on the Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression methodology developed by Mathias von Ottenbreit.

# How to install
pip install aplr

# Availability
Currently available for Windows and most Linux versions.

# How to use
Please see the two example Python scripts in the examples folder. They cover common use cases, but not all of the functionality in this package. For example, fitting with user-specified observation weights is possible but the example scripts do not use this functionality.
